# Assignment machine learning
# Ex1:Naive Bayes
Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer to interpret hand written text as the characters.
In this assignment we will be trying to recognize numbers from images. To accomplish this task, we
will be using a Naive Bayes classifier.
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers that are based on Bayes’ theorem.
These algorithms work by combining the probabilities that an instance belongs to a class based on
the value of a set of features. In this case we will be testing if images belong to the class of the
digits 0 to 9 based on the state of the pixels in the images.
## Requirement
To complete this assignment you will need to use C++ to write a program the uses the Naive
Bayes Algorithm described above to classify the provided images. This program should run on the
command line and must have some interface to implement at least the following features. <br>
• Read training data from files and generate a model <br>
• Save a model as a file <br>
• Load a model from a file <br>
• Classify images from a file <br>
The interface you design to allow the user to accomplish these tasks is up to you but is expected to
run correctly from the command line.
Remember to plan your assignment out before writing it and breaking it apart into the appropriate
necessary functions and book keeping values that you will need to keep.
Finally you will also need to evaluate your classifier.

# Ex2:K-means
Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. This technique
can be used by companies to outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and
services.
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar
characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs.
Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing
products and services.
## Requirements
To complete this assignment you will need to use python to write a program the uses the k-means
algorithm described above to predict clusters the provided data. This program must run on the google
colab with requirements: <br>
1. Implement K-means using numpy only, do not use any machine learning library. <br>
2. Find the optimal k – cluster <br>
3. Run k-means with the optimal k. <br>
4. Visualizing K-Means Clustering results to understand the clusters. <br>
5. Make understanding about the data after clustering. <br>
